# Code-Quiz

## Description

I created a coding quiz covering some simple javascript questions. This quiz was more for me to really start to understand and get a good grasp on javascript and web APIS. This project really helped me understand and get comfortable creating functions and utilizing all of my tools to create a dynamic and responsive webpage. This project also helped familiarize me with local storage, both saving values and displaying them on the webpage. In the future it would be very easy to modify/add questions to the quiz to really test my knowledge as I start to learn more.

## Usage

When the webpage is first loaded up, you are met with the homepage, a start quiz button, or view highscores button. If the highscores button is clicked it takes you to the highscore page. When the start quiz button is clicked, the first question as well as a timer appears. You select what you believe to be the right answer to the question and click the next button. Depending on if you were right or wrong a small prompt under the quiz lets you know if you were correct or incorrect. If you were incorrect, 10 seconds is deducted from the timer. If you run out of time during the quiz, you are met with an out of time page where you can start over and try again. If you complete the quiz with time remaining, you are taking to the submit score page where your score (which is the remaining time left on the timer) is displayed, and a box to input your initials. When you click the submit button you are directed to the highscore page. Your score with your initials, aswell as the previous takers, is saved to the highscore page. At the highscore page you can choose to go back to the start page and take the quiz again, or clear all the highscores saved to the page.
